# Titanic Classification Project

Hey there! 👋 This is my first GitHub project . I've been learning data science and decided to try my hand at the classic Titanic dataset - you know, predicting who survived and all that.



## Running This
You'll need to grab the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and save it as `titanic_dataset.csv` in the same folder. Then just open `titanic_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and you should be good to go!

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or feedback - I'm always learning!
